This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison. The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, and `0` if it's found at the beginning of the haystack.  Since `false` is also considered `0` in a loose comparison, the condition `strpos($haystack, $needle) == 0` will incorrectly evaluate to true when the needle is not found at the beginning, but rather elsewhere or not at all.
