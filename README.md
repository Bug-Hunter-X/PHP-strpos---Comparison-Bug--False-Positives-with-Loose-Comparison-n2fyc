This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to the `strpos()` function and loose comparison. The `strpos()` function, when used with loose comparison (using `==` instead of strict comparison `===`), can lead to incorrect results due to PHP's type juggling behavior.  The provided code showcases the error and its solution. The solution uses strict comparison (`===`) to ensure accurate results, preventing false positives.
